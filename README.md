# Fireflies

My first piece of work. Using HTML5 canvas, I render a number of glowing dots, each illustrates a basic agent model, which carries out different behaviours depends on the interactions made from your mouse. For instance, a click creates a spark which cause the fireflies to flee, holding on generates a fire which attracts them, and any fast movements causes wind to blow them away.
